Comment: Typing this on S20 base model. The size feels just right in hands and S24 should've been a natural upgrade. But the slew of missing features is disappointing, based on rumours so far.

Comment: Not quite sure if I should upgrade to S24, or go for S23 due to Snapdragon, or just change my S20 battery and hang on to it until Z Flip 6 comes (hopefully with DEX).

Comment: My S20 has Exynos too, holding quite well except for battery. Got a couple of thick but light pink lines in display, non-intrusive for usage.

Comment: 25W charging is no slouch. I switched from a Xiaomi 11T Pro which supported 120W so it took some getting used to but I don't believe there is much difference in Samsung's 25W and 45W charging from the YT videos.

Comment: FHD is more than sufficient for a screen this size. Don't worry about that.

Comment: Exynos is a true sore spot. As someone who used the Exynos S9 and Snapdragon S9 side by side for a year, I can tell you both experiences were a world apart. Hope Samsung can at least match the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2

Comment: Yeah, it's a difference of 5 minutes when going from 0 to 100.

Comment: Wait 120W? I know that this has existed for a long time but it still baffles me to this day. How long does it take to charge and how many hours SOT?

Comment: Based on the experience of my S23 and what I know from the S23 lineup:
